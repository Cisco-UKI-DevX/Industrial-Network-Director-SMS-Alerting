# Cisco Industrial Network Director SMS Alerting

## SMS Alerting with Industrial Network Director (Under development)

This python script utilises Cisco Industrial Network Director to send an SMS  when a new device alert occurs on IND.

When the user runs the python script they are queried for information around their IND setup, Twilio account and phone number. The script then proactively monitors IND to send an SMS anytime a new alert is encountered.
